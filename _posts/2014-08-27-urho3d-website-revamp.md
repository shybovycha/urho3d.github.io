We have recently revamped our website while preserving its original [minimal theme](http://orderedlist.com/minimal/) as much as possible. Although the appearance does not change much, under the hood we have made a number of changes to make the website design becomes more responsive and to make the documentation viewing easier than before, from large screen monitor down to small mobile devices. What makes this possible is the adoption of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) front-end framework.

We have also added two new features to the website:

1. Document-switcher which allows user to see the evolution of the documentation pages from different releases and the current HEAD revision.
2. Disqus commenting service which allows user to comment on the news post entries. Tell us what do you think by leaving us a comment.
